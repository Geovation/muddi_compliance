# MUDDI Compliance
Project for the development of validation techniques to ensure ingress and egress of data is MUDDI (Model for Underground Data Definition and Integration) compliant.

## Database
We sought to examine how a schema that conformed to MUDDI could be created to support the ingestion of typical utility source data. We organised the OGC code sprint work into creation of a backend to store MUDDI-compliant data and a front end to display it. To facilitate the task, we had to transform open utility data into MUDDI-compliant data.

## JSON-FG
The aim of the JSON-FG work was to investigate creating a MUDDI compliant method for supporting the exchange of underground asset data between trusted parties. Using JSON-FG we could support a MUDDI schema while retaining the correct EPSG code.
